# Finance Performance & Budget Analytics — Requirements

## Business Context
Finance leaders require timely, accurate, and trusted visibility into budget performance, cost drivers, and overall spend composition to support decision-making, planning, and financial governance.

Operational data is often fragmented across cost centers, accounts, and time periods, making it difficult to:
- Assess whether the organization is operating within budget
- Identify cost centers and accounts driving variances
- Understand enterprise-level spend mix and utilization

This project simulates a SAP-style finance analytics environment and delivers structured dashboards to address these needs.
